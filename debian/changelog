ssh-legion (0.1.5) stable; urgency=high

  [ Alois Klink ]
  * fix: fix bash file descriptor leak
    The ssh-legion bash script has a leak when the ssh process fail.
    This can cause the ssh tunnel to fail after a while,
    **WITHOUT the ssh-legion process exiting**.

ssh-legion (0.1.4) stable; urgency=low

ssh-legion (0.1.3) stable; urgency=medium

  [ Alois Klink ]
  * build(debian): bump minimum bash version to v4.4
  * fix: fix ssh-legion not closing `ssh` on SIGTERM
    Fixes on OpenWRT, where running `/etc/init.d/ssh-legion stop`
    would not actually stop the underlying SSH tunnel.

ssh-legion (0.1.2) stable; urgency=low

  [ Alois Klink ]
  * fix(debian): fix invalid service files
    These files were incorrectly called `.config`,
    and were therefore not being installed properly.
  * fix: suppress `cat` error on missing machine-id
  * feat: warn when picking a random ssh tunnel port
  * Improve the `ssh-legion --check` function
    It now actually tests whether a tunnel can be created.
  * fix: seed RANDOM number generator with machine id.
    ssh-legion will now always try to use the same ports.
  * fix: close child processes on SIGTERM/SIGINT
    Required for OpenWRT and other simpler init systems.
  * fix: log ssh stdout/err to ssh-legion stdout/err
    Improves logging, especially with systemd-journald
  * fix: kill SLEEP_PID only if it exists
    Suppresses an error message when running the `--check` cmd.
